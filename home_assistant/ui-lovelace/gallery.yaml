    # FFS, because, using AN EXISTING STANDARD for parsing and formatting is too hard
    # file_name_format isn't a file name format, but should be something like file_name_datetime_format,
    #   because it doesn't encapsulate the full name, only a part of it
    # localisation doesn't work for the caption
    # caption format should just use the same setting as HA (as default)
    # the fromNow/AGO functionality doesn't work:
    #   past dates rendered as dates in the future if a time is part of the datetime
    # this stinks shit balls
    # don't use it
    file_name_format: 'YYYYMMDD-HHmmss'
    caption_format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'
