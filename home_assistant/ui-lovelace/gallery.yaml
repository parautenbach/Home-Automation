        # file_name_format isn't a file name format, but should be something like file_name_datetime_format,
        #   because it doesn't encapsulate the full name, only a part of it
        # localisation doesn't work for the caption
        # caption format should just use the same setting as HA (as default)
        # the fromNow/AGO functionality doesn't work:
        #   past dates rendered as dates in the future if a time is part of the datetime
        # this stinks shit balls
        # don't use it
